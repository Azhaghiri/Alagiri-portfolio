        I am a B.Com graduate and a trained MERN Stack Developer with hands-on
        experience in building responsive and user-friendly web applications.

        along with backend technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

        I am a quick learner, highly motivated, and passionate about building
        real-world applications that solve practical problems. I am currently
